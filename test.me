Okay, now, I've made my macro package for a bridge.
Let's try it out.
.{b 2m \" 2ems from origin.
.bb
Okay, this looks good.
.bb
Enforce it a little...
.{b 2m \" 4ems from origin.
.bb
Okay, here's another block for my bridge.
.{b 4m \" 8ems from origin.
.bb
Whoa!
That was quite a big jump.
.bb
Let me make this stronger.
It's just two more ems till I reach the other side!
.{b 2m \" 10ems from origin.
.bb
OMG YES I DID IT!!
.bb
I've reached the other side, 10ems away from where I stood.
.}b \" 8ems from origin.
.bb
I can go back...
.}b \" 4ems from origin.
.bb
I can go back safely, without falling!
.}b \" 2ems from origin.
.bb
Almost there!!
.}b \" 0ems from origin.

Done!
